# Foodtastic
Foodtastic is a company specialized in organic and regional products selling. To develop their customers' directory, they requested your help to create a custom online shop website that will display every products stored in their catalog. However, in view of a wider marketing, your product may be used for other companies and therefore not exclusively reserved for Foodtastic. This company is available in five cities: Paris, Marseille, Montreal, Berlin and Rome. As products are not available in each area, the online shop should be separated in these five areas. The application should have a responsive display to be used on tablets and smartphones. For this project, you can use any client libraries (such as CSS templates, JS-client libraries) to create a nice display. However, no server library except the ones explicitly listed on this document should be used: you must develop it your own way.
